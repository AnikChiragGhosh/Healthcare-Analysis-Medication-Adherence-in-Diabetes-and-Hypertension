# Healthcare-Analysis-Medication-Adherence-in-Diabetes-and-Hypertension
This project focuses on analyzing medication adherence among patients diagnosed with Diabetes and Hypertension using a real-world dataset. The goal is to understand the key drivers of adherence behavior and build predictive models to identify high-risk non-adherent patients.

## üß† Objectives

‚Ä¢ Explore and clean patient-level healthcare data.
‚Ä¢ Engineer new features such as refill gaps, polypharmacy flags, and complication development.
‚Ä¢ Build and evaluate predictive models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest) to classify patients as Adherent or Non-Adherent.
‚Ä¢ Identify key factors impacting medication adherence.
‚Ä¢ Provide actionable recommendations for pharmaceutical companies and healthcare policymakers.


## üõ†Ô∏è Dataset Summary

Dataset Source: Mendeley Data ‚Äî Diabetes and Hypertension Medication Adherence Dataset
### Key Features:
Demographics: Age, Gender
Clinical: Diagnosis, Complications, Comorbidities
Financial: Annual Claim Amount, Annual Contribution
Medication Metrics: Units Total, Refill Patterns

## üìà Key Analytical Steps
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
‚Ä¢ Distribution of adherence behavior across demographics and clinical variables.
‚Ä¢ Correlation analysis to uncover relationships among variables.
### Feature Engineering:
‚Ä¢ Creation of POLYPHARMACY_FLAG, REFILL_GAP, COMPLICATION_COUNT.
‚Ä¢ Binning of age into AGE_GROUP.
### Model Building:
‚Ä¢ Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier.
‚Ä¢ Hyperparameter tuning (max depth, number of trees, entropy criterion).
‚Ä¢ Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.
### Feature Importance Analysis:
‚Ä¢ UNITSTOTAL and ANNUALCLAIMAMOUNT emerged as top predictors.
‚Ä¢ Clinical variables like AGE, COMPLICATIONDEVELOPMENT, and COMORBIDITY showed moderate influence.

## üéØ Results
Random Forest achieved strong classification performance with feature-driven insights.
Top predictors of non-adherence:
High Units Total (Medication Burden)
High Annual Claim Amount (Healthcare Burden)
Advanced Age
Presence of Complications and Comorbidities
